## Immediate Todo

1. Move calculation of neighbor mines to seperate function
2. on first move make sure it isnt a mine
    - if it is, remove it, set a new mine and recalculate neighbors
3. game end detection and modal
4. fancy styling? (instead of just borders)

## Later Todo

1. Stats
2. Powerups?
