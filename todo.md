## TODO next

<!-- 1. make assets preloaded ( don't know if it does anything) -->

1. Make all loading from localstorage safe with null coalescing (prob not gonna do since no more breaking changes)
2. clicking on numbers opens safe spots around if flagged properly

## TODO in no particular order

1. Alternate flag system that just right clicking?
2. Custom board sizes (I made it possible, just don't have a ui for it)

### Done
