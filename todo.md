## TODO next

1. make assets preloaded ( don't know if it does anything)

## TODO in no particular order

1. Themes (light theme first)
2. Overall Stats
3. In-game stats (number flags, mines, etc)
4. Alternate flag system that just right clicking?
5. Custom board sizes (I made it possible, just don't have a ui for it)

### Partially Done

1. Better style and colors
    - Tired of looking at gray
    - Color gradients for more lively appearance?
2. Art (mines, flags, some icons)

### Done

1. Multi-save system
2. All mines get opened when you click one
3. "If a mine was in the 3x3 of no mines, just place it elsewhere"
4. Multiple Select on save games, to delete multiple at a time.
5. dedicated back button on game screen (made it a clickable title instead)
6. make all mines show up, even covered ones, with miniboard showMines
7. text in cells make better.
