## Final Bugs

1. ~~No times text in times not centered~~
2. ~~Board messed up on full width~~

## TODO next

-   Nothing!

### Not Going To Do

1. make assets preloaded ( don't know if it does anything)
2. Make all loading from localstorage safe with null coalescing (prob not gonna do since no more breaking changes)
3. Custom board sizes (I made it possible, just don't have a ui for it)

### Done

1. Multi-save system
2. All mines get opened when you click one
3. "If a mine was in the 3x3 of no mines, just place it elsewhere"
4. Multiple Select on save games, to delete multiple at a time.
5. dedicated back button on game screen (made it a clickable title instead)
6. make all mines show up, even covered ones, with miniboard showMines
7. text in cells make better.
8. In-game stats (number flags, mines, etc)
9. Themes (light theme first)
10. Overall Stats
11. Light theme support
12. make stats and settings ssr
13. Make store for theme as well as the themeIndex
14. make cell background constant depending on theme.
15. make cell color respond correctly to light theme
16. if all flags are placed correctly, the left side stat should be green.
17. clicking on numbers opens safe spots around if flagged properly
18. Info screen for how to play and credits.
19. edit save game name
20. make toggle for default click action
21. leaderboards for each difficulty.
22. remove unfinished custom game ui.
23. fix click number (i think done)
