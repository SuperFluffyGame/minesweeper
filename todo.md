## Immediate Todo

1. Move calculation of neighbor mines to separate function
2. on first move make sure it isn't a mine
    - if it is, remove it, set a new mine and recalculate neighbors
3. game end detection and modal
4. fancy styling? (instead of just borders)

## Later Todo

1. Stats
2. Power ups?
3. Irregular Boards?

TODO in no particular order

1. Multi-save system
2. Overall Stats
3. In-game stats (number flags, mines, etc)
4. Art
5. Alternate flag system that just right clicking?
6. Custom board sizes (I made it possible, just don't have a ui for it)
7. All mines get opened when you click one
